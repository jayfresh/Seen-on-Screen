						<h4>What to expect from a One To One Class</h4>
						<p>You will receive a personalised training session with your chosen member of our elite dance team. Not only are they fantastic dance professionals and teachers, they have danced for your favourite stars.</p>
						<p>Whether you want to get fit or perfect your dance skills, our one to one sessions are perfect for you. Getting the body of your dreams doesn't have to be a chore. Dancing is addictive and releases endorphins that make you feel great, so you'll look forward to your next session. You will burn up to 400 calories an hour, working muscles you never knew you had while loving every minute of it. Want to try it out? Book a Seen On Screen session now.</p>
