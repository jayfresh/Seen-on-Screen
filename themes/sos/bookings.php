						<h4>What to expect from a One to One Class</h4>
						<p>You will receive a personalised training session with our elite dance team. Not only are they fantastic dance professionals and teachers, they have danced for your favourite stars.</p>
						<p>One to One sessions are great because they are all about you. Whether you want to get fit or perfect your dance skills, we will cater the class especially to your needs. We also offer 'get fit with a friend' sessions from 2-5 people, so you can get the one to one attention you require. For anything over, why not consider one of our group workshops. Getting the body of your dreams doesn't have to be a chore. Dancing is great fun and effective.</p>
